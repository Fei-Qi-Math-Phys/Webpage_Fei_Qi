		<ul>
		<p>We covered the Stewart Textbook Section 2.2. Here are some key facts you should keep in mind.&nbsp;</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Numerical experiments help to guess the limit. But it is not reliable.&nbsp;</li>
				<li>The limit of a function f(x) at a number x = a depends only on the behavior NEAR x = a, while independent of the function behavior AT x = a.&nbsp;</li>
				<li><img class="equation_image" title="\lim_\limits{x\to a} x = a, \lim\limits_{x\to a} c = c" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/%255Clim_%255Climits%257Bx%255Cto%2520a%257D%2520x%2520%253D%2520a%252C%2520%255Clim%255Climits_%257Bx%255Cto%2520a%257D%2520c%2520%253D%2520c?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: \lim_\limits{x\to a} x = a, \lim\limits_{x\to a} c = c" data-equation-content="\lim_\limits{x\to a} x = a, \lim\limits_{x\to a} c = c" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />.&nbsp;</li>
				<li>The limit exists if and only if both one-sided limits exist and are equal to each other.&nbsp;</li>
				<li>If the left-hand limit is not equal to the right-hand limit, then the limit does not exist.&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Basic principles in deciding infinite limits:&nbsp;</li>
				<ol><li>A positive number dividing a small positive number is positively large. So the limit is <img class="equation_image" title="+\infty" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/%252B%255Cinfty?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: +\infty" data-equation-content="+\infty" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />.&nbsp;</li><li>A positive number dividing a small negative number is negatively large. So the limit is <img class="equation_image" title="-\infty" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/-%255Cinfty?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: -\infty" data-equation-content="-\infty" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />.&nbsp;</li><li>A negative number dividing a small positive number is negatively large. So the limit is <img class="equation_image" title="-\infty" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/-%255Cinfty?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: -\infty" data-equation-content="-\infty" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />.&nbsp;</li><li>A negative number dividing a small negative number is positively large. So the limit is <img class="equation_image" title="+\infty" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/%252B%255Cinfty?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: +\infty" data-equation-content="+\infty" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />.&nbsp;</li>
				</ol>
				</ol>
		<p>Please keep in mind&nbsp; that essential materials will be re-written on the board. If I am reading the slides without writing on the board, I do not expect you to master the knowledge. For example, I introduced the intuitive definition of limit in class. Having some ideas of this definition would be far more than enough. To seriously handle this definition requires much more sophisticated training in first-order logic, which is way beyond the level of first-year Calculus.</p>
		<p>Another example is the numerical experiment. I went over the topic very fast simply to assist the understanding of limits and, more importantly, show the existence of pitfalls. I will not expect the students to carry out any numerical experiments.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>As a result, please do not waste your energy on taking notes of the slides. All slides are released in the course folder. You may revisit it by yourself and at your own pace any time at your convenience. Please keep you energy only for the materials I write on the board.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Homework Problems today will be 2.2 exercises. You are now ready for almost every problem except for 8(c) and 44(a). Problem 12 requires certain knowledge of trigonometry functions and piecewise functions. We will not have more lecture time to review these concepts. Please go over either the videos or the slides for 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 (in Week 00 folder).&nbsp;</p>

	<summary>Lecture 3 on 1/11/2023</summary>
		<ul>
		<p>We finished Section 2.2 and the first half of 2.3. Here are the things to keep in mind:&nbsp;</p>
		<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
			<li><img class="equation_image" title="\lim\limits_{x\to \left(\pi/ 2\right)^-} \tan x = +\infty, \lim\limits_{x\to \left(\pi / 2\right)^+} \tan x = -\infty, \lim\limits_{x\to 0^+} \ln x = -\infty" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/%255Clim%255Climits_%257Bx%255Cto%2520%255Cleft(%255Cpi%252F%25202%255Cright)%255E-%257D%2520%255Ctan%2520x%2520%253D%2520%252B%255Cinfty%252C%2520%255Clim%255Climits_%257Bx%255Cto%2520%255Cleft(%255Cpi%2520%252F%25202%255Cright)%255E%252B%257D%2520%255Ctan%2520x%2520%253D%2520-%255Cinfty%252C%2520%255Clim%255Climits_%257Bx%255Cto%25200%255E%252B%257D%2520%255Cln%2520x%2520%253D%2520-%255Cinfty?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: \lim\limits_{x\to \left(\pi/ 2\right)^-} \tan x = +\infty, \lim\limits_{x\to \left(\pi / 2\right)^+} \tan x = -\infty, \lim\limits_{x\to 0^+} \ln x = -\infty" data-equation-content="\lim\limits_{x\to \left(\pi/ 2\right)^-} \tan x = +\infty, \lim\limits_{x\to \left(\pi / 2\right)^+} \tan x = -\infty, \lim\limits_{x\to 0^+} \ln x = -\infty" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /></li>
			<li>Algebraic laws for limits concern the following operations: Sum, Difference, Constant Multiple, Product, Quotient, Power, and Root. <br />These laws are intuitive. But please make sure you use them correctly. The laws work only when the conditions are satisfied. Anything can happen if the conditions fail (cf. Example 1b, Example 1').</li>
			<li>Another set of laws concerns the limit of x, the limit of constant, and the limit of powers of x.<br />3.1. Please make sure you can justify the steps as I did in Example 2. Please practice with Problem 6 in the 2.3-HW. <br />3.2. Using these laws together with algebraic laws, we can prove the direct substitution property for polynomial and rational functions. Please find the details in the homework solution. They will not be required in quizzes or exams.</li>
			<li>The direct substitution property fails when you get 0/0, which means you are dealing with a type of indefinite limit. You should use algebra (factorization, expansion, rationalization) and transform it to a definite limit.&nbsp;</li>
			</ol>
			<p>For HW-2.3, you are now ready for everything in the first three pages and the first three on the fourth page. These problems, together with the ones in 2.2, may appear in the quiz next Monday.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Note: Generally the homework problems are more difficult than the example problems I went over in class. So it is completely natural to struggle. Please do not hesitate to ask for help from me and from Collier.&nbsp;</p>

	<details><summary>Lecture 4 on 1/18/2023</summary>
		<ul>
				<p>Today we finished Section 2.3 and started the discussion of Section 2.5. Here is the knowledge you need to keep in mind.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>1. For the limit of a piecewise function at a critical number (where the function has two different definitions to the left and the right), you should use one-sided limits to take care of the ambiguity.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>2. The limit comparison theorem is very important theoretically, but we will not be using it a lot.</p>
		<p>3. For the squeeze theorem, please make sure you are comfortable with the example x^2 sin(1/x), and Problem 38, 40 in the Homework. For Problem 40, you should use the fact that the function e^x is increasing to obtain upper and lower bound functions.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>4. Example 10 and Example 11' will not be required, and I skipped them in class. You are welcome to work on them by yourself. Feel free to ask for assistance for sure.&nbsp;</p>
		<p><span>5. A function <img class="equation_image" title="f(x)" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/f(x)?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: f(x)" data-equation-content="f(x)" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> is continuous at a number a if</span></p>
		<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
			<li><span><img class="equation_image" title="f(a)" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/f(a)?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: f(a)" data-equation-content="f(a)" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> is defined.</span></li>
			<li><span><img class="equation_image" title="\lim\limits_{x\to a} f(x)" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/%255Clim%255Climits_%257Bx%255Cto%2520a%257D%2520f(x)?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: \lim\limits_{x\to a} f(x)" data-equation-content="\lim\limits_{x\to a} f(x)" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> exists.</span></li>
			<li><span><img class="equation_image" title="\lim\limits_{x\to a} f(x)" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/%255Clim%255Climits_%257Bx%255Cto%2520a%257D%2520f(x)?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: \lim\limits_{x\to a} f(x)" data-equation-content="\lim\limits_{x\to a} f(x)" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> coincides with the function value <img class="equation_image" title="f(a)" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/f(a)?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: f(a)" data-equation-content="f(a)" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />.</span></li>
		</ul>
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; These three conditions are compactly incorporated into the equation <img class="equation_image" title="\lim\limits_{x\to a} f(x) = f(a)" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/%255Clim%255Climits_%257Bx%255Cto%2520a%257D%2520f(x)%2520%253D%2520f(a)?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: \lim\limits_{x\to a} f(x) = f(a)" data-equation-content="\lim\limits_{x\to a} f(x) = f(a)" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /></p>
		<p><span>6. Types of discontinuities:</span></p>
		<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
			<li><span>Removable: <img class="equation_image" title="\lim\limits_{x\to a} f(x)" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/%255Clim%255Climits_%257Bx%255Cto%2520a%257D%2520f(x)?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: \lim\limits_{x\to a} f(x)" data-equation-content="\lim\limits_{x\to a} f(x)" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> exists but not equal to <img class="equation_image" title="f(a)" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/f(a)?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: f(a)" data-equation-content="f(a)" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> or <img class="equation_image" title="f(a)" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/f(a)?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: f(a)" data-equation-content="f(a)" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> does not exist. We call it removable because it can be removed by redefining (or defining) <img class="equation_image" title="f(a)" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/f(a)?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: f(a)" data-equation-content="f(a)" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />.</span></li>
			<li><span>Infinite discontinuity: One of the one-sided limits is infinity (positive or negative). Equivalently, when <img class="equation_image" title="x=a" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/x%253Da?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: x=a" data-equation-content="x=a" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> is a vertical asymptote.</span></li>
			<li><span>Jump discontinuity: Both the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit exist, but they are not equal.</span></li>
			<li><span>Other types, e.g., <img class="equation_image" title="f(x) = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{x}\right)" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/f(x)%2520%253D%2520%255Csin%255Cleft(%255Cfrac%257B%255Cpi%257D%257Bx%257D%255Cright)?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: f(x) = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{x}\right)" data-equation-content="f(x) = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{x}\right)" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />.</span></li>
		</ul>
		<p><span>7. We use left-hand-limits and right-hand-limits to define continuity from the left and continuity from the right.</span></p>
		<p><span>8. A function is continuous on an interval if the function is continuous at every number in the interval.</span> <br /><span>8.1. If the number happens to be the left endpoint of the interval, we require the function is continuous at the number from the right. </span><br /><span>8.2. If the number happens to be the right endpoint of the interval, we require the function is continuous at the number from the left. </span><br /><span>Make sure you know how to appropriately justify that a function is continuous on an interval.</span></p>

		<p>Basically after today's lecture, you should know that most elementary functions are continuous on its domain. The direct substitution property works not only for polynomial and rational functions, but also works for trig, exp and log functions. Next lecture we will finish 2.5 with compositions of continuous functions and intermediate value theorem. You are now ready for all homework problems in 2.5 except for 36, 38, 53, 55, 62, 52. Please attempt them to prepare for the quiz on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Since we will have two quizzes on Monday and Wednesday, plus that we have not finished 2.7 and 2.8, I decided to push the quiz back for another week. That shall leave you enough time preparing for it.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>We finished the discussion of continuous functions.&nbsp;Here are things you need to keep in mind:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
    <li>If <img class="equation_image" title=" \lim\limits_{x\to a}g(x) = b " src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/%2520%255Clim%255Climits_%257Bx%255Cto%2520a%257Dg(x)%2520%253D%2520b%2520?scale=1" alt="LaTeX:  \lim\limits_{x\to a}g(x) = b " data-equation-content=" \lim\limits_{x\to a}g(x) = b " data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> while <img class="equation_image" title="f(y)" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/f(y)?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: f(y)" data-equation-content="f(y)" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> is continuous at <img class="equation_image" title="y=b" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/y%253Db?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: y=b" data-equation-content="y=b" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />, then the limit of the composite function <img class="equation_image" title="f(g(x))" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/f(g(x))?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: f(g(x))" data-equation-content="f(g(x))" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> as x approaches <img class="equation_image" title="a" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/a?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: a" data-equation-content="a" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> is simply <img class="equation_image" title="f(b)" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/f(b)?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: f(b)" data-equation-content="f(b)" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />. You may also interpret it as that the limit operation commutes with <img class="equation_image" title="f" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/f?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: f" data-equation-content="f" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />, i.e., <br /><img class="equation_image" title="\lim\limits_{x\to a}f(g(x)) = f(\lim\limits_{x\to a}g(x))" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/%255Clim%255Climits_%257Bx%255Cto%2520a%257Df(g(x))%2520%253D%2520f(%255Clim%255Climits_%257Bx%255Cto%2520a%257Dg(x))?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: \lim\limits_{x\to a}f(g(x)) = f(\lim\limits_{x\to a}g(x))" data-equation-content="\lim\limits_{x\to a}f(g(x)) = f(\lim\limits_{x\to a}g(x))" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /><br />This fact is useful in the computation of limits of complicated functions.</li>
    <li>Compositions of continuous functions are continuous. This fact is useful in deciding where a complicated function is continuous.</li>

    	<li>Limits at infinity and asymptotes. The definitions are too long to fit in here. Please find them in the slides.</li>
    	<li>To compute the limits of fractions at infinity, the standard technique is to divide both the numerator and the denominator by the highest power in the denominator. This technique is especially helpful in handling a <img class="equation_image" title="\frac \infty \infty" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/%255Cfrac%2520%255Cinfty%2520%255Cinfty?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: \frac \infty \infty" data-equation-content="\frac \infty \infty" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />-type indefinite limit.&nbsp;</li>
    	<li>Be careful when radicals are involved. When you are computing the limit at negative infinity and want to put something inside a radical, please make sure you follow the rules carefully:</li>

	<ul>
		<p>We finished the leftovers in 2.6 and all the discussions in 2.7. Homework for today will be the exercises in those two sections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are things you need to keep in mind:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Currently we have seen three types of indefinite limits: <img class="equation_image" title="\frac{0}{0}, \frac{\infty}{\infty}, \infty - \infty" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/%255Cfrac%257B0%257D%257B0%257D%252C%2520%255Cfrac%257B%255Cinfty%257D%257B%255Cinfty%257D%252C%2520%255Cinfty%2520-%2520%255Cinfty?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: \frac{0}{0}, \frac{\infty}{\infty}, \infty - \infty" data-equation-content="\frac{0}{0}, \frac{\infty}{\infty}, \infty - \infty" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />. For such indefinite limits, you need to use algebra to transform them into definite limits. It requires experience and practice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Generally speaking, for any quantity <img class="equation_image" title="y = f(t)" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/y%2520%253D%2520f(t)?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: y = f(t)" data-equation-content="y = f(t)" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> that changes over time, the average rate of change from <img class="equation_image" title="t = a" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/t%2520%253D%2520a?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: t = a" data-equation-content="t = a" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> to <img class="equation_image" title="t = b" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/t%2520%253D%2520b?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: t = b" data-equation-content="t = b" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> is given by the difference quotient&nbsp;<br /><img class="equation_image" title="\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta t} = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/%255Cfrac%257B%255CDelta%2520y%257D%257B%255CDelta%2520t%257D%2520%253D%2520%255Cfrac%257Bf(b)%2520-%2520f(a)%257D%257Bb-a%257D?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta t} = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}" data-equation-content="\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta t} = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /></p>
<p>2.1. Geometrically, the difference quotient is the slope of the secant line passing through <img class="equation_image" title="(a, f(a))" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/(a%252C%2520f(a))?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: (a, f(a))" data-equation-content="(a, f(a))" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> and <img class="equation_image" title="(b, f(b))" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/(b%252C%2520f(b))?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: (b, f(b))" data-equation-content="(b, f(b))" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />.&nbsp;<br />2.2. In case <img class="equation_image" title="y = f(t)" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/y%2520%253D%2520f(t)?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: y = f(t)" data-equation-content="y = f(t)" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> is the position function of an object moving along the number line, the difference quotient stands for the average velocity from <img class="equation_image" title="t = a" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/t%2520%253D%2520a?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: t = a" data-equation-content="t = a" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> to <img class="equation_image" title="t = b" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/t%2520%253D%2520b?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: t = b" data-equation-content="t = b" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. The instantaneous rate of change is given by the limit of the difference quotient&nbsp;<br /><img class="equation_image" title="\lim\limits_{b\to a}\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta t} = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}.
" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/%255Clim%255Climits_%257Bb%255Cto%2520a%257D%255Cfrac%257B%255CDelta%2520y%257D%257B%255CDelta%2520t%257D%2520%253D%2520%255Cfrac%257Bf(b)%2520-%2520f(a)%257D%257Bb-a%257D.%250A?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: \lim\limits_{b\to a}\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta t} = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}.

<p>The computation of derivatives by its definition is an important skill. Please make sure you fully understand all the details. Next lecture, we will see some more examples.&nbsp;</p>

	<details><summary>Lecture 8 on 2/1/2023</summary>
	<ul><p>Today we finished most of Stewart 2.8. P<span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-size: 1rem;">lease pay special attention to the piecewise function problems.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Here are what you need to keep in mind:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. The derivative <img class="equation_image" title="f^{\prime}\left(a\right)" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/f%255E%257B%255Cprime%257D%255Cleft(a%255Cright)?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: f^{\prime}\left(a\right)" data-equation-content="f^{\prime}\left(a\right)" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />, as the number a varies, defines a function, which will also be called the derivative of <img class="equation_image" title="f" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/f?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: f" data-equation-content="f" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />, denoted <img class="equation_image" title="f^{\prime}" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/f%255E%257B%255Cprime%257D?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: f^{\prime}" data-equation-content="f^{\prime}" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />. The derivative <img class="equation_image" title="f^{\prime}" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/f%255E%257B%255Cprime%257D?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: f^{\prime}" data-equation-content="f^{\prime}" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> might have its own derivative, called the second derivative, denoted <img class="equation_image" title="f^{\prime\prime}" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/f%255E%257B%255Cprime%255Cprime%257D?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: f^{\prime\prime}" data-equation-content="f^{\prime\prime}" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />. We can repeat the process and define the n-th derivative <img class="equation_image" title="f^{(n)}" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/f%255E%257B(n)%257D?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: f^{(n)}" data-equation-content="f^{(n)}" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> for any positive integer<img class="equation_image" title="n" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/n?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: n" data-equation-content="n" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. If <img class="equation_image" title="s=s(t)" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/s%253Ds(t)?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: s=s(t)" data-equation-content="s=s(t)" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> is the position function of an object moving along a straight line, then the first derivative is the velocity, the second derivative is the acceleration, and the third derivative is the jerk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. If a function <img class="equation_image" title="f" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/f?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: f" data-equation-content="f" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> has a horizontal tangent at a number <img class="equation_image" title="a" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/a?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: a" data-equation-content="a" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />, the <img class="equation_image" title="f'(a) = 0" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/f'(a)%2520%253D%25200?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: f'(a) = 0" data-equation-content="f'(a) = 0" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />. We have seen in class that if a function is increasing (resp. decreasing) on an interval I, then the derivative <img class="equation_image" title="f'(x) &gt; 0" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/f'(x)%2520%253E%25200?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: f'(x) &gt; 0" data-equation-content="f'(x) &gt; 0" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> (resp. <img class="equation_image" title="f'(x) &lt; 0" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/f'(x)%2520%253C%25200?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: f'(x) &lt; 0" data-equation-content="f'(x) &lt; 0" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />) for every <img class="equation_image" title="x" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/x?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: x" data-equation-content="x" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> in the interval I. Using this observation, we can <em>roughly</em> sketch the graph of <img class="equation_image" title="f'" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/f'?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: f'" data-equation-content="f'" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> based on the graph of <img class="equation_image" title="f" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/f?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: f" data-equation-content="f" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. The domain of <img class="equation_image" title="f'" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/f'?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: f'" data-equation-content="f'" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> can be smaller than the domain of <img class="equation_image" title="f" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/f?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: f" data-equation-content="f" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />.

<p>Here is what you should keep in mind:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here is what you should keep in mind:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
    <li>The normal line of <img class="equation_image" title="y=f\left(x\right)" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/y%253Df%255Cleft(x%255Cright)?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: y=f\left(x\right)" data-equation-content="y=f\left(x\right)" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> passing through <img class="equation_image" title="\left(x_0,y_0\right)" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/%255Cleft(x_0%252Cy_0%255Cright)?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: \left(x_0,y_0\right)" data-equation-content="\left(x_0,y_0\right)" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> is a line perpendicular to the tangent line.&nbsp;<br />1.1.

You are now ready for all the leftover problems (40 - 50) in the Homework for 3.3. Please review trigonometry and make sure you are comfortable with everything in the notes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is what you need to keep in mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Many trigonometric limits can be computed by the knowledge of<img class="equation_image" title=" \lim\limits_{x\to 0}\displaystyle{\frac{\sin x} x} = 1" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/%2520%255Clim%255Climits_%257Bx%255Cto%25200%257D%255Cdisplaystyle%257B%255Cfrac%257B%255Csin%2520x%257D%2520x%257D%2520%253D%25201?scale=1" alt="LaTeX:  \lim\limits_{x\to 0}\displaystyle{\frac{\sin x} x} = 1" data-equation-content=" \lim\limits_{x\to 0}\displaystyle{\frac{\sin x} x} = 1" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />. To figure out when to apply this formula, you must be skillful in trig identities. You should do the trig review now if you haven't done it yet.&nbsp;<br />2. Chain rule can be applied either using the formula in terms of outer and inner functions, i.e.,&nbsp;<br /><img class="equation_image" title="[f(g(x))]' = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)," src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/%255Bf(g(x))%255D'%2520%253D%2520f'(g(x))%2520%255Ccdot%2520g'(x)%252C?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: [f(g(x))]' = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)," data-equation-content="[f(g(x))]' = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)," data-ignore-a11y-check="" /><br />or using the formula with Leibniz notation, i.e.,&nbsp;<br /><img class="equation_image" title="\displaystyle{\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \frac{du}{dx}.&nbsp;}" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/%255Cdisplaystyle%257B%255Cfrac%257Bdy%257D%257Bdx%257D%2520%253D%2520%255Cfrac%257Bdy%257D%257Bdu%257D%2520%255Cfrac%257Bdu%257D%257Bdx%257D.%25C2%25A0%257D?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: \displaystyle{\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \frac{du}{dx}.&nbsp;}" data-equation-content="\displaystyle{\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \frac{du}{dx}.&nbsp;}" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /><br />The former is faster and recommended by the textbook, but sometimes may cause confusion when the function is complicated. The latter is slower but will usually clear all possible confusion. I would suggest using the latter for complex problems.&nbsp;</p></ul></details>

	<ul><p>We finished the tricky chain rule problems and the implicit differentiation. Note that the video and the slides does not contain any discussion of inverse trigonometric functions because Canadian universities normally leave them to Calculus II. In case you did not make it to the lecture, please make sure to get the notes from your peers. We discussed the inverse function and the formula for the derivative. As an application, we have obtained the derivatives of ln x, arcsin(x), and arctan(x).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Homework problems this week will be the leftover trig limits in 3.3, together with the problems in 3.4 and 3.5. Please go over them and get fully prepared for the quiz and midterm next week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is what you need to keep in mind:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. The implicit differentiation is convenient in obtaining <img class="equation_image" title="\displaystyle{\frac{dy}{dx}}" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/%255Cdisplaystyle%257B%255Cfrac%257Bdy%257D%257Bdx%257D%257D?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: \displaystyle{\frac{dy}{dx}}" data-equation-content="\displaystyle{\frac{dy}{dx}}" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> from a relation of x an y.</p>
<p>1.1. When you take the derivatives of an expression of y, remember to use the chain rule that <img class="equation_image" title="\displaystyle{\frac{d}{dx} F(y) = F'(y) \frac{dy}{dx}}" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/%255Cdisplaystyle%257B%255Cfrac%257Bd%257D%257Bdx%257D%2520F(y)%2520%253D%2520F'(y)%2520%255Cfrac%257Bdy%257D%257Bdx%257D%257D?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: \displaystyle{\frac{d}{dx} F(y) = F'(y) \frac{dy}{dx}}" data-equation-content="\displaystyle{\frac{d}{dx} F(y) = F'(y) \frac{dy}{dx}}" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.2.

	<ul><p>Today we talked about derivatives involving logarithmic functions, together with logarithmic differentiation. I will not require logarithmic differentiation in the quizzes and the exams, though it is a good technique to know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also discussed related rates. The mathematics of related rates is easy: once you get the relation, simply apply d/dt on both sides. The difficult part is to mathematicalize the problem. We will not be very demanding on the kind of models&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the knowledge you need to keep in mind:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.<span> <img class="equation_image" title="(\log_b x)' = \displaystyle{\frac 1 {x\ln b}}, (\ln x)' = \displaystyle{\frac 1 {x}}.

<p>1.1. These formula can be extended as<span> <img class="equation_image" title="(\log_b |x|)' = \displaystyle{\frac 1 {x\ln b}}, (\ln |x|)' = \displaystyle{\frac 1 {x}}.

I did skip the details in class. But these extensions will be important in Calculus 2. Rigorously this extension is also necessary for logarithmic differentiation.

<p><span>3. If two quantities are related, then their rates of change are related.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3.1. The relation of the rates of change are obtained by implicit differentiation. Note that you are supposed to view all the variables as functions of the time, and use chain rule accordingly.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3.2. Please make sure you do not plug in any numbers before taking d/dt. Only plug in the numbers after taking d/dt.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3.3. We will only be requiring similar models in Example 1-4. Today we finished Example 1-3. I will still go over Example 4 together with Example 5 on Wednesday.&nbsp;</span></p></ul></details>

</summary>
	<ul><p>We finished the discussion of related rates in Section 3.9 and started the discussion of maximum and minimum values in Section 4.1.</p>
<p>In the final exam, only the models of Example 1 - 4 in 3.9 will appear. Please make sure you understand those models and the related homework problems. The model in Example 5 will appear in many engineering and science courses. If you do have time and energy, please go over it. I will not require that model in the final exam.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have posted two video explaining all the 3.9 HW problems on Canvas. Note that the first 26:30 of the video "3.6-3.9-HW.mp4" covers logarithmic differentiation, which will not be required in the final. 3.9 homework starts from 26:30. There is a supplementary video "3.9-HW-Last-Three.mp4" covering the last three problems in 3.9-HW.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding 4.1, here is the knowledge you should keep in mind.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
    <li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What is the absolute maximum, the absolute minimum, a local maximum, a local minimum of a function.&nbsp;</span></li>
    <li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Extreme Value Theorem: A&nbsp;<strong>continuous&nbsp;</strong>function on a&nbsp;<strong>closed interval&nbsp;</strong>always attains absolute maximum and absolute minimum.&nbsp;</span></li>
    <li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Critical number c: either f'(c) = 0 or f'(c) DNE.&nbsp;</span></li>
    <li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Modified Fermat's theorem: If f takes a local maximum or local minimum at x = c, then c is a critical number of f.&nbsp;</span></li>
    <li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Closed interval method: To find the absolute maximum and minimum of a continuous function, we first find all the critical numbers, then compare the function values at the critical numbers and endpoints. The largest number will be the absolute maximum; the smallest will be the absolute minimum.&nbsp;</span></li>

	<ul><p>We did another example from Section 4.1, then briefly discussed Mean Value Theorem and discussed almost everything in 4.3 (only leaving Second Derivative Test). You will need to use inequalities extensively in this section to handle the related problems. If you don't feel confident, please go over the techniques in second chance materials for midterm 1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is what you should keep in mind:&nbsp;</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Mean value theorem: If a function f is continuous on [a, b], differentiable at (a,b), then there exists c \in (a,b), such that <img class="equation_image" title="f'(c) = \displaystyle{\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}}.&nbsp;" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/f'(c)%2520%253D%2520%255Cdisplaystyle%257B%255Cfrac%257Bf(b)-f(a)%257D%257Bb-a%257D%257D.%25C2%25A0?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: f'(c) = \displaystyle{\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}}.&nbsp;" data-equation-content="f'(c) = \displaystyle{\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}}.&nbsp;" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /></span></li>
    <li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If a function has zero derivative <strong style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-size: 1rem;">on an interval</strong><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-size: 1rem;">, then the function is constant on that interval. </span></span></li>
    <li>If two functions have the same derivatives <strong style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-size: 1rem;">on an interval</strong><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-size: 1rem;">, then they differ by a constant. </span></li>

    <li>Knowing where a function is increasing and decreasing, we can decide if a function takes local max or local min at a critical number.

</summary>
	<ul><p>We summarized the guideline of graph sketching in class. In order to convey the ideas for the initial examples, I deliberately ignored the subtle issues involving critical numbers where the derivative does not exist.</p>
<p>Here is the complete version of the guideline, which has some discrepancy to the version in the video and slides.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Domain: Find the domain of the function.</li>
    <li>Intercepts: Find the y-intercept by setting x = 0 (which is usually very easy). Find the x-intercept by setting y = 0 (if the equation is too complicated then skip this step).</li>
    <li>Symmetry: Decide if the function is odd, even or periodic.
        <ul>
            <li>Recall: f(x) is an even function if <img class="equation_image" title="f\left(x\right)=f\left(-x\right) \text{ for every }x \text{ in the domain.}" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/f%255Cleft(x%255Cright)%253Df%255Cleft(-x%255Cright)%2520%255Ctext%257B%2520for%2520every%2520%257Dx%2520%255Ctext%257B%2520in%2520the%2520domain.%257D?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: f\left(x\right)=f\left(-x\right) \text{ for every }x \text{ in the domain.}" data-equation-content="f\left(x\right)=f\left(-x\right) \text{ for every }x \text{ in the domain.}" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> In this case, the graph of f is symmetric about the y-axis.</li>
            <li>Recall: f(x) is an odd function if <img class="equation_image" title="f\left(x\right)=-f\left(-x\right) \text{ for every }x \text{ in the domain.}" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/f%255Cleft(x%255Cright)%253D-f%255Cleft(-x%255Cright)%2520%255Ctext%257B%2520for%2520every%2520%257Dx%2520%255Ctext%257B%2520in%2520the%2520domain.%257D?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: f\left(x\right)=-f\left(-x\right) \text{ for every }x \text{ in the domain.}" data-equation-content="f\left(x\right)=-f\left(-x\right) \text{ for every }x \text{ in the domain.}" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> In this case, the graph of f is symmetric about the origin.</li>
            <li>Recall: f(x) is T-periodic if <img class="equation_image" title="f\left(x+T\right)=f\left(x\right) \text{ for every }x \text{ in the domain.}" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/f%255Cleft(x%252BT%255Cright)%253Df%255Cleft(x%255Cright)%2520%255Ctext%257B%2520for%2520every%2520%257Dx%2520%255Ctext%257B%2520in%2520the%2520domain.%257D?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: f\left(x+T\right)=f\left(x\right) \text{ for every }x \text{ in the domain.}" data-equation-content="f\left(x+T\right)=f\left(x\right) \text{ for every }x \text{ in the domain.}" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> In this case, we may skech the graph of f over one period, then translate it to get the full graph.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>&nbsp;Asymptotes:
        <ul>
            <li>Compute the limits at positive infinity and negative infinity and decide if there exists any horizontal asymptotes.</li>
            <li>For the vertical asymptote, find out if there exists numbers where the function value explodes to positive infinity and negative infinity. Usual candidates for such numbers are at the boundary of the domain.</li>
            <li>(not required) For slant asymptotes, find if there exists m, b making <img class="equation_image" title="\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}(f(x) - (mx+b)) = 0" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/%255Clim%255Climits_%257Bx%255Cto%255Cinfty%257D(f(x)%2520-%2520(mx%252Bb))%2520%253D%25200?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: \lim\limits_{x\to\infty}(f(x) - (mx+b)) = 0" data-equation-content="\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}(f(x) - (mx+b)) = 0" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />. For rational functions, slant asymptote exists only when the degree of numerator = 1 + degree of denominator. The slant asymptote can be found by long-division.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Compute the derivative. Find the critical numbers by figuring out where f'(x) = 0 and where f'(x) does not exist.
        <ul>
            <li>If f'(c) = 0, then f has a horizontal tangent at c.</li>
            <li><strong>(Did not mention in class)</strong> If f'(c) does not exist and c is in the domain, find out the left-hand limit and right-hand limit of f'(x) at c and decide if we have a vertical tangent or a cusp point. In greater detail (did not emphasize in the video):
                <ul>
                    <li>If <img class="equation_image" title="\lim\limits_{x\to c^+} f'(x) = \lim\limits_{x\to c^-} f'(x) = \infty" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/%255Clim%255Climits_%257Bx%255Cto%2520c%255E%252B%257D%2520f'(x)%2520%253D%2520%255Clim%255Climits_%257Bx%255Cto%2520c%255E-%257D%2520f'(x)%2520%253D%2520%255Cinfty?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: \lim\limits_{x\to c^+} f'(x) = \lim\limits_{x\to c^-} f'(x) = \infty" data-equation-content="\lim\limits_{x\to c^+} f'(x) = \lim\limits_{x\to c^-} f'(x) = \infty" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />, then f is increasing near c and has a vertical tangent at c.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>If <img class="equation_image" title="\lim\limits_{x\to c^+} f'(x) = \lim\limits_{x\to c^-} f'(x) = -\infty" src="https://canvas.du.edu/equation_images/%255Clim%255Climits_%257Bx%255Cto%2520c%255E%252B%257D%2520f'(x)%2520%253D%2520%255Clim%255Climits_%257Bx%255Cto%2520c%255E-%257D%2520f'(x)%2520%253D%2520-%255Cinfty?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: \lim\limits_{x\to c^+} f'(x) = \lim\limits_{x\to c^-} f'(x) = -\infty" data-equation-content="\lim\limits_{x\to c^+} f'(x) = \lim\limits_{x\to c^-} f'(x) = -\infty" data-ignore-a11y-check="" />, then f is increasing near c and has a vertical tangent at c.&nbsp;</li>

            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>I/D test: Critical numbers separate the real line into intervals. For each interval, figure out the sign of f'(x) to decide if the function is increasing or decreasing.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Local maximum and minimum: Use the results from I/D test to figure out if the function takes a local max or local min at each critical number.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Compute the second derivative. Find the critical numbers (of the first derivative) that separate the real line in different intervals. Use the concavity test to decide if the function is concave upward or downward on each interval. Find out the coordinates of each inflection point.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Mark the points of interest on the coordinate plane. Draw the vertical and horizontal asymptotes in dash lines. Analyze the behavior near these points and asymptotes. Then connect these bits of information by curve using the information we have obtained above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>You should now be ready for all homework problems in 4.1 and 4.3. 4.2 will not be required this quarter. You may also try some problems in 4.5 but note that we haven't finished that section. We shall finish it next Monday, then turn to applied optimization in 4.7.&nbsp;</p></ul></details>

I'll try to cover Example 4.5.4 and 4.5.5 after conducting a review. Although I will not ask you to graph such functions, seeing the process may help you to review the necessary knowledge regarding trigonometric functions and logarithmic functions in other sections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two more examples in Section 4.5, namely, an algebraic function in Example 4.5.2, and an exponential function in Example 4.5.3. I have created the videos discussing all these examples, together with all the exercises in 4.5. You may find them in the OneDrive folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
