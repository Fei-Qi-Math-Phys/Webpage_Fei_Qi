<p><strong>What do you like best about this course?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>Fei was such a helpful guy. The material was interesting. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The availability and willingness of the instructor to assist any students with the course material if they were having any problems. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Helps to cover supplemental material</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>without this TA this course would have been hell!</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Challenging</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Fei&#039;s office hours were by far the most helpful tool in this course to succeed. He gave applicable problems and worked along with you individually until you understood it.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Mr Fei Qi is the best TA that I have ever had. He has been incredibly helpful, even outside of class  and always holds extended office hours</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Fei was always so enthusiastic about teaching the material, and he taught very well. He taught very comprehensively, he offered frequent and helpful office hours, and constantly uploaded helpful resources to Sakai.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>A lot of real world applications (and cross course relevance).</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>If you were teaching this course, what would you do differently?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>shorter quizzes more examples</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Not teach topics that are not covered by the professor and then have a quiz on those new topics that wont be needed for any tests.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>None.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>n.a</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>No Mathematica assignments</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Not much. We were taught well and also challenged a lot.
</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Not much, Fei handled it very well.</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>In what ways, if any, has this course or the instructor encouraged your intellectual growth and progress?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>Fei was great. super helpful</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Has plenty of office hours.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Very hardworking TA, replies to emails within minutes. Prepares lecture slides for every recitation and also provides material from other sites.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Very enthusiastic </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Fei is an amazingly smart man, and whatever negative is said about him, the students don&#039;t try to get help individually. Fei is always there to offer such help, he should truly be a professor. He is so interested in the material, while still being helpful. Overall, this man does the best out of any math TA I&#039;ve ever had.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>He has always encouraged students to come to office hours, where he is very helpful and understanding </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I already loved math and I am already pursuing a Minor in Mathematics. This course has supported this decision of mine, and also made me consider possibly turning my Minor in Mathematics to a second major. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Encouraged further development of general math manipulation skills.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Fei is an awesome teacher. You could tell he really knew what he was talking about. He would always stop to answer questions and was always available above and beyond the required time for office hours. He simplified things by doing them in many different ways so you understood the concept, and also showed us tricks and better ways of doing the problem.</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>Other comments or suggestions:</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>none </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>He will take the time to help you no matter what as long as you inform him. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>He should have been the professor for Calc 4 instead of TA. I hope he is my professor for calc 5!</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>n.a</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Give this man a medal.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Fei was great. He went above and beyond what I expected of a TA. He would spend countless hours helping me on a certain topic until both him and myself were certain that I understood it. A complete pleasure to learn from him.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Fei was a great TA. Amazingly helpful and friendly. I understand the material very thoroughly because of his help and teachings. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Fei gives excellent summaries in regards to class material and went out of his way to provide additional learning resources which I felt were of great help.</q></p></blockquote><hr></div>
