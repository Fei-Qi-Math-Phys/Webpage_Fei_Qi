<p><strong>What do you like best about this course?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>going over what was just learned </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I liked the teacher&#039;s timeliness with returning assignments.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Learn the material quickly and efficiently</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Fei Qi was very generous with bonus points and was fair in his grading</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>When there werent any quizzes</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I liked that he spent the time to talk and know each student in the class</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Mr. Qi was very helpful and taught very well.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>There was a good structure to the recitation. Fei didn&#039;t just come to class and expect questions; he actually prepared something to talk about and left time for questions.</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>If you were teaching this course, what would you do differently?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>not make quizzes count and not have maple</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I would not give weekly quizzes that are more difficult than the exams generated by the lecturer.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I wouldn&#039;t hold the students after class because recitation lasted a bit long.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Not give such hard quizzes and explain the maple labs better!</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Shorter quizzes, more organized class, better understanding of student limita and time constraints</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Less theoretical/conceptual math and more practical math.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Not be as condesending. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I would give easier quizzes for people who arent math majors</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I would have better time management. We went over time or had to rush quizzes too often</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The quizzes were WAY too difficult given the material we were learning in lecture. We were also given almost no time to complete the quizzes before class was over. I would leave more time for questions and less time on lecturing on irrelevant topics. Also, extra assignments were uncalled for -- giving review problems as a helpful hint is fine, but threatening &#039;penalties&#039; for those who didn&#039;t &#039;review enough&#039; was not a graduate student&#039;s place.</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>In what ways, if any, has this course or the instructor encouraged your intellectual growth and progress?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>included extra links for more practice</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The instructor has expanded my understanding of differential equations.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>He gave us extra material to look over in case we&#039;ve forgotten Calc 1-3</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Bonus points encouraged students to be attentative during class and after class.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Not really</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I can tell Mr. Qi has a passion for mathematics, and I am always pleased when teachers go out of their way to show something above the material or give more of a conceptual explanation to things we learn in lecture. It was very motivating.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>None. Fei was rude to people who asked dumb questions and was very impatient. He did offer review problems on topics we may have forgotten, like algebra techniques and calc 2 special integration, and offered second chances at failed/poorly performed assignments, which was greatly appreciated.</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>Other comments or suggestions:</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>-</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>He was really smart, but he focused to much to the point not realizing the course is for engineers not math majors</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>N/A</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>His accent and mentality towards school was took a bit of getting used to but I think both the student and the teacher grew in that regard. He definitely cares about teaching and got better as the semester went on.  The grading scheme does kind of stink, lightly weighing our maple labs which take hours and overweighing our in class quizzes which tended to be very difficult. He is a good guy though</q></p></blockquote><hr></div>
