<p><strong>What do you like best about this course?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>It was an opportunity to ask questions if we had any.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Questions were sometimes answered. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>He answered questions well.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The subject matter</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The enthusiasm the professors and TAs give about the course material</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>If you were teaching this course, what would you do differently?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>make the recitation material more synchronous with the lecture material</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I would not give students difficult quizzes, or keep students after class to take the quizzes. The quizzes were impossible to finish in the time allotted, not to mention that the quiz was always given after class, whihc was a problem for those who had class afterwards. 
</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Give quizzes only on material ALREADY covered in lecture </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Not spend so much time on irrelevant material causing class to go late often.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Work on time-management and focus mostly on the course material the professor presents in lectures and lecture notes. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The quizzes were very challenging and nothing like the homework or the exams so, to be consistent, I would base the quizzes off the style of the homework.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Sometimes I found that your explanations and pace is a little too fast. So maybe slow down a little next time?</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>In what ways, if any, has this course or the instructor encouraged your intellectual growth and progress?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>My intellectual growth was not encouraged by this course </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Nothing significant</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>Other comments or suggestions:</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>He generally went over the time limit, which gave us less time for the quizzes (which are usually very difficult). He was a good TA, but some of his quizzes were unfair in that they were far too difficult to do in the amount of time given, or they tested us on things far more complicated than would ever show up in lecture or on an exam. In his defense, the recitation is very short (only 55 mins vs 80 mins). </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The quizzes should be more liek the homework and the class should not always run over time. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>It would have helped to have an hour and twenty minute recitation for Diff.Eqs. 55 minutes for recitation was just way too short, especially with a quiz to cram in at the last 10 minutes. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The quizzes were hard but he always explained them afterwards and even disregarded the ones everyone did bad on. Great TA!</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The language barrier was hard to break because of his broken English, it took me a while but for some people in the class I could tell they could still not understand him.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Your recitations were very good review and I appreciate that you try to help your students as much as possible. Your quiz questions are reasonable, but sometimes I felt that there just isn&#039;t enough time to answer two questions. Perhaps you can make the quizzes one question if that one question requires a lot of steps to solve?

Thank you so much for teaching me this semester :)</q></p></blockquote>
