<p><strong>What do you like best about this course?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>I hated absolutely everything about this class. This guy was so unreasonably harsh. No matter how hard you work in this class, he will not do anything to help you. He has a heart is a black hole and believes that even if 2/3 of the class fails the exams, then all those people should fail. If those many people are failing, there is something clearly wrong with how he is teaching. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Besides the subject, I liked the fact that I could pay attention to the lectures since the professor posted them online.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I like how engage the professor is with his student. he seem to care alot about how his students are doing. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Fri&#039;s notes are very good and he posts them online so if you miss something in class you can always review his notes. Also Fei took our input in how to change the course to better suite our needs.  </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Professor Qi! The material itself is interesting, of course, but his presentation was really a treat.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Fei provided countless amounts of office hours for students and always responded to email questionnaires in a fair amount of time. He was always prepared to provide help if students were seeking it. Offered numerous chances to make up homework to not only better grasp material but encourage us to practice material we failed to grasp initially if homework was performed poorly. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I like the way that it was presented, and the availability of the professor for office hours.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Everything</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The content of the course itself is very challenging, as I feel that such critical thinking has not been as prevalent/required in the NJ high school curriculum. As a result, a number of students, including myself, find this course to be only the second proof based course taken to date. Despite the heavy workload, it was still intriguing for me to better understand why a given theorem is accurate.</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>If you were teaching this course, what would you do differently?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>He doesn&#039;t know how to teach. He just goes on doing proofs after proofs without explaining any intuition or stopping to explain what the hell he is talking about. I would try to assign a reasonable work load and be understanding on exams. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I would probably write on the black board only because it force me to pay attention more. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Nothing.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I would provide more examples of how to solve proofs. By this I mean actually include the steps and thought process involved in solving some proofs. This would help students get a better grasp as to how to use definitions and previous proofs to solve homework problems. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>There isn&#039;t much I would do differently. Possibly make notes slightly clearer but that&#039;s not a huge issue at all.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Nothing</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>A few changes I would have done differently includes beginning the class with a brief overview of the previous lesson. This will allow students to recall past information and to set the learning environment in place for the new lesson. Another initiative I would have implemented is a more narrowed review guide for exams. Although, this can be debatable depending on the instructor---because this may seem to gear towards the instrumental understanding. However, I feel that it depends on the student; as a more narrowed review guide also allows students to understand certain concepts relationally vs only gaining a surface level of a broader amount of concepts due to the time constraints on a large amount of information.</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>In what ways, if any, has this course or the instructor encouraged your intellectual growth and progress?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>He has in fact killed all my desire in Math. He is exactly the person I do not want to become. I know a lot of people in the class who feel the same way. This guy believes that by failing people by giving ridiculously hard tests is the proper way to teach. In fact, it is demoralizing and kills our motivation. I mean, if no matter how hard you try you will still end up failing, then what&#039;s the point? That&#039;s actually what&#039;s been happening. He himself is noticing that students our not doing as well on the exams.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Giving challenging homework.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I really like how the professor try to use different approach to help student understand the materials. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Yes... Proofs are hard and I initially struggled with them but now they aren&#039;t that bad. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Professor Qi is very knowledgeable in his field, far beyond the mere requirements of this course. His ability to identify the point at which a student is really getting stuck on a problem, his desire for all students to thoroughly understand the material, and his energy at every lecture make analysis--a subject undergraduates often think of as difficult and mystifying--lucid and enjoyable.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Provided numerous opportunities to make up work I failed to successfully complete or understand for partial credit. This encouraged me to practice material over and over allowing me the opportunity to learn more and make up my grade as to not hinder my process in the course. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Fei was one of the most caring and understanding professors I&#039;ve had. He reached out to me as well as other students regarding issues in classwork that they need to improve on, and engaged with the classroom a lot. Considering the material isn&#039;t incredibly interesting, he made it more interesting by involving the classroom more.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Everyway</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I felt the professor has high expectations for his students and I find that this was encouraging for some. Another aspect that struck me was that although he expected a lot, he was understanding of students&#039; struggle with the course and offered extra help through office hours. Consequently, this pairs well with the authoritative style of teaching which I find to personally thrive better in. It encouraged me to strive more than I have previously while allowing me to feel slightly more comfortable with my abilities whether better/worse than expected.</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>Other comments or suggestions:</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>This guy is a complete sociopath. He expects us to do EVERY single problem in the book!! What he fails to understand is that the homework itself takes hours to do, and there are hundreds of problems in the book! It is simply overwhelming. We have lives, we have jobs, we have families to support. This guy has so much time on his hands to do all this math, but he forgets that normal people have need lives too. There is no balance...he expects everyone to do &quot;EVERY PROBLEM IN THE BOOK!&quot; Fei Qi should NEVER be allowed to teach anymore class!</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Fei is the best. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Fei is a very good instructor. In lecture he can come off as intimidating but he cares deeply about each student and their progress.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Thank You. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Fei also referred me to disability services which no other professor has done. He really cares about his students and how they perform in the class, whilst also preparing you for other classes as well.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>N/A</q></p></blockquote><hr></div>
