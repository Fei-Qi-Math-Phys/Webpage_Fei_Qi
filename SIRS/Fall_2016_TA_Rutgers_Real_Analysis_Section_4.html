<p><strong>What do you like best about this course?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>This is a very challenging course and the TA is one of the best I&#039;ve had. He is willing to help no matter what and holds ample office hours for students. He truly wants  you to do well in this course and learn a great deal- because of him, I have. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Fei is a great TA. He lectures and is very helpful. He held office hours frequently and was overall great.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Fei was incredibly helpful. Please allow him to continue being a TA for Math 311</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I liked how Fei was able to help just a little bit by giving hints without giving the answers to the whole problem. A lot of the time I was stuck, but the small hints made me understand the rest of the problem.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The workshop sessions were very helpful in understanding the material. The TA was very positive towards questions and making sure that we had a grasp of the real analysis fundamentals.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The part of office hour is my favorite part. Because we always can figure out a lot of questions and it&#039;s more effective than the class time. Prof. Fei is extremely responsible, always holding a lot of office hours with clear explanations. He can stay as long as students need which also inspired me learning more.</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>If you were teaching this course, what would you do differently?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>Nothing. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Not much. Maybe provide more resources to study from for the students.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The workshops were easily frustrating early on and then got easier. It would be nice if the difficulty curve was more consistent.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I think more quizzes of basic theorems with typical examples well as examples could help for further understanding. </q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>In what ways, if any, has this course or the instructor encouraged your intellectual growth and progress?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>He has never once made me feel as though I couldn&#039;t do it or I wasn&#039;t going to succeed. He was always encouraging and patient when I wasn&#039;t grasping concepts easily. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>He helped understand all the material that I didn&#039;t learn during the lectures. I think having workshops in 311 is great.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Fei helped me out a lot by giving me extra materials to study, which were a lot easier to understand than our actual class materials.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Fei is an excellent professor. He cares students a lot and can understand us. His specific suggestions of understand theorems systematically inspires me learning math. We all respect him. Also, the discussions of typical workshop questions in class somewhat provides me more perspectives of thinking and analyzing. </q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>Other comments or suggestions:</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>Mr. Qi originally started off the workshops by teaching us more upon what we did in lecture. He then explained that he wasn&#039;t necessarily supposed to do that and we had to work more in groups. As i understand that is the real intention for the Workshops, his original method was much better than what was expected of him. I learned more about the subject and the material when he was explaining it and reviewing with us than what i learned in lecture. Also being in a Workshop for Abstract Algebra and it being done the way i believe the Math department intended it to be, it is extremely inefficient. Having another lecturer teaching and reviewing certain problems that we did not learn in lecture teaches more to the students than handing them a piece of paper with problems and a topic they have never seen before and expecting them to ask questions. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Great TA!!! </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>They only thing that was really frustrating was that the format of the workshop changed weekly, with it sometimes being split into groups, and sometimes just being a lecture.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Thank you so much Professor Fei. Your passion and devotion to math let me know the learning process is more important.</q></p></blockquote><hr></div>
