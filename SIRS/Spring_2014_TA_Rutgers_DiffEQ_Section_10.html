<p><strong>What do you like best about this course?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>Fei would go completely out of his way to make sure everyone understands the material. He was even open to holding office hours during spring break and will often extend office hours way past what is necessary. His teaching technique is great. Fei goes step by step and writes down each portion. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The material is interesting.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Professor Fei Qi&#039;s priority was that the students LEARNED math, beyond the simple requirements. He really encouraged personal growth among students.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The additional office hours offered by the instructor. I would not have undersstood the material as well if not for his help and tutoring.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The topics were reviewed before taking quizzes.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>How everything was expalined in a lot of detail and was clear</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>He explained things very well. It seemed like he really cared. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The help of ta</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>If you were teaching this course, what would you do differently?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>I would give much easier quiz questions. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Nothing; Fei Qi was the best TA that I&#039;ve had at Rutgers so far.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Avoid having the quiz topic on something that we had just learned in lecture a few days earlier. (setting the quiz material back a week so that students have time to prepare and understand the material before they are quizzed on it).</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Honestly nothing. Fei did a great job</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Made sure there was time for quizes. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Shorter quizzes</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Nothing, great TA.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Do not teach new methods that the professor did not teach.  Do not teach new material and then quiz students on it.  Do not hand out quiz after class is over and expect students to be able to stay late and take it.</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>In what ways, if any, has this course or the instructor encouraged your intellectual growth and progress?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>He has shown me that putting in the effort to go to office hours is worth your time.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Fei does a good job at explaining the material and encourages learning more advanced concepts as well which has really encouraged me to go the extra mile in my studies. I am very lucky to have such an amazing recitation instructor, probably the best calc recitation instructor I ever had at Rutgers. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Fei Qi&#039;s passion for math and teaching students math really inspired me. I am seriously considering a dual math major with my current engineering major.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>He has encouraged me to keep practicing and really seek to understand the material. He also used many types of additional learning tools such as MIT lectures, supplimental worksheets and hand-outs, as well as his own lecture slides. All these resources further helped with my understanding of the course. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>fei is honestly one of the best TAs i have ever had. he really wants us to do well in the course and learn the material </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>He has made himself available at any time for any student</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>It showed me that no matter how bad it might seem if I put my time and effort into it I can still do amazingly.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Homeworks and explanations </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Had a great passion for the subject that transferred into the students.</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>Other comments or suggestions:</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q> Fei is an excellent and exceptional TA. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I am extremely appreciative of Fei Qi going above and beyond to help and tutor me in Diff Eq. His dedication to his students should be recognized. He really wants to see his students exceed, and he has no problem going out of his way to help them.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>It was a pleasure being in your recitation</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Thank you Fei Qi, I learned a great deal from you.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>You were very helpful and it was great that you were always available to answer questions and always very willing to help out students.  Powerpoints were a little long, they were helpful but if they were more concise/ shorter it might have been more helpful.  Thank you for a great semester!</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Fei was really great. I know that he taught us some things that were not required or on exams but those things were helpful and ultimately made us better at math.  He is yet another example of the wonderful TAs at Rutgers...they really give 110% to us and it&#039;s admirable how dedicated they are. I appreciate his help. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I really like this class and the way he taught it, but I had a hard time.understanding when he taught this in theory. I would finally understand once he would show the examples.</q></p></blockquote><hr></div>
