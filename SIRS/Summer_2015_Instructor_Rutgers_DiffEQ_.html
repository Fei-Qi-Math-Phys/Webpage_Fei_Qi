<p><strong>What do you like best about this course?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>Instructor was incredibly accommodating and knowledgeable. He was incredibly accessible and would give as much as he can to students. Overall excellent professor</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I like how every class incorporates several example problems that very closely resemble the material on the exams.
</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Posting notes online</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The professors was by far the best professor that I have had at the university. Nothing was tested or assigned for homework that was no covered thoroughly </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>That he cared about us learning. And was very helpful and was easy to reach if we had questions outside of class time. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>He provides enough depth (proofs, etc) to create interest and conceptual understanding, while still focusing enough on the material itself and what is tested. Homework is used to ensure students practice implementing the techniques we learn, but at no point is it excessive enough to feel like &quot;busy work&quot;. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The teacher made me interested so I would actually want to pay attention in class and he graded very very fairly.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Fei really did a great job teaching this course. He kept us at a good pace, making sure everyone kept up along the way. I really enjoyed his class, something I can&#039;t say for many math classes.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>That during most of the classes all of the notes were written on an ipad and then posted online. This made it easier to focus on understanding the concepts rather than struggling to get down every word.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>What I liked best was the fact that the professor was very helpful in understanding the material.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The lectures were given from a TAs perspective, so additional insight was added where prior understand issues were had.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>In particular, I really liked how the professor taught this course&hellip; The course had a great structure in general, and the instructor seemed very engaged in the material, despite the early morning hours!</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>professor was very well versed in the course</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>He gives out free cake at the end of each class!</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>If you were teaching this course, what would you do differently?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>I would talk a little bit more slowly as to not cause any confusion.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>No maple labs</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Not much</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Nothing, it was great.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Nothing</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>For the last part of the course also post the notes online, perhaps by occasionally taking pictures of the board.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I would not do anything differently.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Nothing, Fei Qi did a great job!</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I would probably teach the course in a similar fashion to the way it was taught. Out of all the Math courses I had taking at Rutgers, I definitely think that this course was taught the best, and had a great set up in general! Great Job! </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>nothing</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Save some more cake for myself</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>In what ways, if any, has this course or the instructor encouraged your intellectual growth and progress?</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>Instructor has increased my interest in continuing my education in Math/engineering </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The course strengthened my algebra skills.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>N/a</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Challenged me enough but also encouraged me to excel and succeed in the course </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>By having home work due after every class it was helpful to reinforce the information we just learned in class. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I understood the material and its applications. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>He made me a little more interested in calc.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Fei really shows interest in the material he is teaching and that helps everyone else get interested in the material as well.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>The every night homework definitely helped force me to keep up with the pace of the course.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>He has been really helpful in explaining the material thoroughly.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>He offered extra credit and also supplied personal insight.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>I feel that the instructor of this course did a fabulous job! He was very understanding of situations, and was very accommodating as well! In addition, I felt he was very enthusiastic every morning, and seemed to really want to help students understand the material.  He offered lots of office hours, and brought lots of positive energy into the classroom! In general, I am not the best in math, but the instructor really taught the material in a manner which I understood completely! </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>it has helped me with being able to understand some of the general math formulas origin</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>-</q></p></blockquote><hr>
<p><strong>Other comments or suggestions:</strong>: 
<blockquote><p><q>I know how to solve most of the problems we learned yet I do not understand what I am solving.</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Fei Qi is an outstanding teacher and is fair to all students. I am not a genius and get everything instantly, but the course was made so that if you did the work and payed attention you will succeed in the class. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>He was very clear when teaching, and went over examples. The only this that would improve the class would be if we got solutions to the homework problems to see where we went wrong, instead of just the awnsers to the problems. I was not able to meet with the proffessor after class if I had questions so I had to always email him about things I had questions. But he was overall a great professor. </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>None</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Nope</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Best math class I&#039;ve had at Rutgers</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Nothing else!</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Thank you so much for making my last undergraduate course at Rutgers be fantastic! Part of me dreaded taking this course over the summer, but I am so happy I did!  I have learned so much during this course, and actually enjoyed going to lectures and doing the homework! Fantastic course taught by an amazing professor! Great Job! </q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>very nice professor</q></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><q>Stay cool</q></p></blockquote><hr></div>
