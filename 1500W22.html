We went through some of the most essential parts of the syllabus but also left out a lot of important parts due to the limitation of time. Please definitely read the document by yourself. <BR>
During the lecture I covered the first part of the review of trigonometry. The latter part is covered in a 38-minute supplementary video. Plesae go over the materials and internalize the knowledge, so that trigonometric function won't cause you any troubles in 1500. <BR>

We went over the first half of Exercise 1. It was decided by the poll that we will finish the leftovers on Thursday, which should not take more than 30 minutes. After that, we will start Exercise 2. <BR>
Here is the playlist of <A HREF="https://universityofmanitoba.desire2learn.com/d2l/le/content/479659/viewContent/2776554/View">Eddie Woo's Video on Logarithms</A>. For now, we will only use the fact that the logarithmic function approaches negative infinity as the independent variable approaches zero from the right. But when we discuss logarithmic differentiation, we will have to use everything. I also posted some <A HREF="https://universityofmanitoba.desire2learn.com/d2l/le/content/479659/viewContent/2820932/View">Logarithm Exercises</A> and <A HREF="https://universityofmanitoba.desire2learn.com/d2l/le/content/479659/viewContent/2820931/View">their solutions</A> on UM Learn. We will go over these exercises before discussing logarithmic differentiation. They will not be required in Test 1 and Test 2.

We finished everything in Exercise 1 and started Exercise 2. The pace was much slower than I thought. I had to make two supplementary videos explaining everything in Exercise 2. Part 1 explains all the other computational exercises. Part 2 explains the two theoretically important exercises and Problem 6 where you need to provide justification. <BR> 
I forgot to explain Problem 12 in Exercise 1. The solution is included in the updated notes. In case you have confusions, I can explain it during my office hours.
